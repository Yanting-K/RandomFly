I am a postgraduate student at Donghua University in China. My research topic is **image inpainting**. I like to use **GAN**, **Target Detection** and other **Computer Vision** methods to do some things. At the same time, I am also a Geek, like to use STM32, raspberry PI to **DIY** some interesting projects.

In March of '22, I will graduate and go to work. I hope to update this blog with a few things about:

1. Paper interpretation in the direction of computer vision

2. Some tricks and experience in the game

3. Create interesting DIY projects by combining your knowledge of embedded devices and computer vision
