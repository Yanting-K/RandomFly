I am a postgraduate student at Donghua University in China. My research topic is **image inpainting**. I major in **GAN**, **Target Detection** and other **Computer Vision** methods. Meanwhile, I am also a Geek, I always make some projects with STM32, raspberry PI.

In 22 March 2022, I will graduate and get a job. I hope I can update this blog with some things about:

1. Paper interpretation in the direction of computer vision
   
2. Some tricks and experience in the game
   
3. Create interesting projects by combining your knowledge of embedded devices and computer vision
